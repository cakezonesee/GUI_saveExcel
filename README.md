# GUI_saveExcel
This my other mini project to **store, show, save and update** the names that are input and save it as Excel file. This is my first take on using Tkinter.

In this project I create the GUI interface using Tkinter in Python to create. I do everything in **Jupyter Notebook** as I have to create a DataFrame so I prefer doing everything data related on hear.

Things that the user can do in this interface.

1.**input first** name and **last name** and has the ability to save each name in a format of **list of tuple**
2.**show** the list of the names, **save** it as **Excel file**

3.**Save** those names as a **Excel file**. 
  *WARINING* as in the code user **don't have** the ability to **choose the file name** or **the location** yet
  so if user click **Save** button again, the existing file will be overwrite.

4. **Update** the existing file with new names.
